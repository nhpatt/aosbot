# AOS Bot

This project tries to implement a Telegram bot using AWS Lambda & API Gateway with the intention to serve as a point of 
information for the schedule of the 2017 edition of the Agile Open Spain open-space conference that will be held in 
Segovia (Spain)

It should have two primary functions:

1. Publish reminders for the ahead talks in a Telegram group/supergroup, and other broadcast messages needed by the organization.
2. Be queried by individuals (using private Telegram chats) and return information about the conference schedule.
